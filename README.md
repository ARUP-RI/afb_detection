# Object detection models for acid-fast bacilli screening

TODO: fill in details such as
- links to trained model & datasets on huggingface
- setup instructions with `uv`
- instructions to run training & inference scripts
    - include hyperparams we used for the model run shown in the paper, and maybe guidance on hyperparams
    - replicating paper results: training can be done in ~1-1.5 hr on an L40S, but inference on full validation set (>1.8M tiles) can take ~90-180 min. (Estimates are rough & depend on batch sizes, GPU utilization, early stopping, etc.)
- basic outline of the code logic
