# Object detection models for acid-fast bacilli screening

TODO: fill in details such as
- links to trained model & datasets on huggingface
- setup instructions with `uv`
- instructions to run training & inference scripts
    - include hyperparams we used for the model run shown in the paper, and maybe guidance on hyperparams 
- basic outline of the code logic
